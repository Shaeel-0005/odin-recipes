# **Odin Recipes**  

## **Introduction**  
This project is part of *The Odin Projectâ€™s* curriculum, designed to help me practice the basics of **HTML** and **website structuring**. The goal is to create a simple recipe website that displays different recipes using only HTML.  

## **What I Will Learn**  
By completing this project, I will have demonstrated:  
âœ… Structuring a basic HTML document.  
âœ… Using headings, paragraphs, and lists.  
âœ… Creating links between different pages.  
âœ… Embedding images in a webpage.  

## **Project Structure**  
ðŸ“‚ `odin-recipes/`  
 â”œâ”€â”€ `index.html` *(Homepage listing all recipes)*  
 â”œâ”€â”€ `recipes/` *(Folder containing individual recipe pages)*  
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ `pizza.html`  
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ `pasta.html`  
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ `burger.html`  
 â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *(More recipes...)*  

## **Self-Reflection**  
Looking back, this project helped me reinforce the fundamentals of HTML and improved my understanding of website structuring. As I continue learning, I plan to enhance the project by adding **CSS styling** and making it more visually appealing.
